The UFunK-Pad Sketch comes with Calibration-Data gathered on my exemplar of the Waveshare 2.8inch Touch LCD Shield.
Your device might need other settings. 
If you experience poor or wrong recognition of touch-events, you should calibrate your device.

To get Touchscreen Calibration Data,
upload the "UFunK-Calibration.ino"-Sketch
and do the 4-step calibration process with a Stylus or similar.
Repeat the calibration process until you get a reported Precision below 20 (both for X-Prec and Y-Prec).

Then use the Values for X-Factor, Y-Factor, X-Offset & Y-Offset to edit the "UFunK-Pad.ino"-Sketch.

Update these lines on the top of the Sketch with your new values:

// configure touchscreen conversion factor and offset
// use the data gathered from the touchscreen calibration sketch
// conversion factor:
#define TSC_X_FACTOR 11
#define TSC_Y_FACTOR 14.5
// offset:
#define TSC_X_OFFSET 177
#define TSC_Y_OFFSET 200
